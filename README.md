# Platform for assisting people with disabilities in learning 
This project is about developing a platform to assist people with disabilities in learning. The platform will provide support for students with different types of disabilities in the learning process, allowing them access to various content and tools that will help them master the material.

## Team
The project is led by a team of four members:
Marko Popovic 
Ramiz Sabovic
Belma Hot
Alen Klac
Radovan Popadic
## Methodology
The SCRUM methodology is used to develop this platform. This means that the project is developed iteratively, in short cycles (sprints), which allows the team to quickly respond to changes and focus on the most important tasks.

## Project plan
The project consists of several phases:

Project planning
Defining requirements and user needs
Prototype development
Prototype testing
Final version development
Final version testing
Platform implementation
Each phase consists of several tasks that must be completed before moving on to the next phase. The team will meet once a week to assess project progress and plan tasks for the following week.

## Communication
The team will use WhatsApp and Discord for day-to-day communication, as well as scheduling meetings and reviewing project progress. It will also use GitHub to manage code and project documentation.
